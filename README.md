Unity simulation of our AUV in different arenas.

[Singapore AUV Challenge Arena](/AUV_arena_2020/README.md)

## Pre Requisites

1. [Roll-a-Ball tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball-tutorial)

## Debugging

The versions of Unity may get outdated and this may cause many errors when building the project. The best way to migrate to new versions is by exporting the `GameObjects` and `StandardAssets` used in the project, and import it in the new Unity.
